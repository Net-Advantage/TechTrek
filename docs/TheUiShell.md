# The UI Shell

Every application needs a user interface. The UI Shell is a set of components that provide key application capabilities such as:
- consistent look and feel
- responsive behavior
- theming
- application layout
- composability & extensibility
- accessibility
- navigation
- routing
- reactive behavior
- internationalization
- notifications

TechTrek UI Shell provides a starting point for building an application UI and includes all the items listed above. This section describes each of the above capabilities in more detail.

## Key Capabilities

### Consistent Look and Feel

A consistent look and feel will provide a sense of familiarity to the user. This is accomplished by using the same colors, fonts, and icons throughout the application.

### Responsive Behavior

A responsive application will provide a good user experience across a wide range of devices. This is accomplished by using a responsive grid system and responsive components.

### Theming

A themed application will provide the ability to change the look and feel of the application. This is accomplished by using a theme provider and theme variables.

### Application Layout

The application layout provides structure to the application. This is accomplished by allocating space for various application components.

### Composability & Extensibility

A composable and extensible application applied the DRY principle therefore reducing the need to repeat common aspects of the application. This is achieved by building components that meet the requirements of pre-established contracts or interfaces.

### Accessibility

An accessible application provides the ability for users with various disabilities to use the application. This is achieved by using semantics that target accessibility standards.

### Navigation

A navigable application provides the ability to move between various application components. This is achieved by using a navigation component.

### Routing

A routable application provides the ability to navigate to various application components using a URL. This is achieved by using a router component. Routing can be driven by the Navigation capability or in response to application events.

### Reactive Behavior

A reactive application provides the ability to respond to application events. This is achieved by using a state management library.

### Internationalization

An internationalized application provides the ability to support multiple languages. This is achieved by using a translation library.

### Notifications

A notifiable application provides the ability to notify the user of application events. This is achieved by using a notification library.
